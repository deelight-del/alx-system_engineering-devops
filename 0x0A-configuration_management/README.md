# Puppeteering: Server Configuration Management

Embracing Server Coniguration Management tools and features are good
practices for many reasons but I will outline a few:

1. Quick Server Set up
2. Quick recovery from uneventful server crashes.
3. Ease of replicating servers.
4. Avoiding snowflake (rigidly manually configured) servers
And many more


In this brief stint, we will be using puppet to explore some automation
features of this tool.
